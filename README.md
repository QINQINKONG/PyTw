This repository contains the code for calculating wet-bulb temperature using the Davies-Jones (2008) approach. It is ported from the Fortran code written by Buzan et al (2015) (https://github.com/jrbuzan/HumanIndexMod_2020). The recently identified errors or inappropriate approximations within the Fortran code have been corrected.
